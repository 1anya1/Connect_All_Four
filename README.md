Technologies Used:

Jquery used for onload of game.
Vanilla JavaScript was used to call on elements of the DOM.
Javascript was used to create the game logic.
CSS was used to layout the game and its pieces. 
HTML was used to connect all the pages together and to hold all of html elements of the game. 


Approach taken:
I have tried multiple ways and approaches to tackle this game but what made the most sence was the array method of finding the div elements within each row and column. I first started by drawing the game and visualizing how each column and corresponding row would interact with each other. 

This was done by creating 7 arrays (representing the state value of the game upon rendering) all with 0 values. With this game initiation I assigned value to turnes and the values of winner. 

The main object of the game are the players/ their turns and the corresponding values that are associated with each.

Installation Instruction: NONE


Unsolved Problems: 

There are a few things tha I would like to implement to this project. For instance, adding a scoreboard for each player and keep track of who won and who lost and how many times that took place. 

Reset button upon render of the game. I would like to implement that as well in the future version of the game. 

Creating logic for vertical wins. 

And creating logic for when the game is a tie, so far it work that either one of players win or the board runs out of spaces for chips.
